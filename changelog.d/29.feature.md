added `JWT_AUTH_COOKIE_*` settings paralleling Django's
`SESSION_COOKIE_*` which are used for `JWT_AUTH_COOKIE` and
`JWT_IMPERSONATION_COOKIE`

This changes the default `Secure` attribute from `False` to
`True`. Users wishing to use JWT cookies over http (as in no TLS/SSL)
need to set `JWT_AUTH_COOKIE_SECURE` to `False.`

This change is intentional to follow common best common practice.

With Django versions >= 2.1.0, the `Samesite` attribute is set to
`Lax` by default.
