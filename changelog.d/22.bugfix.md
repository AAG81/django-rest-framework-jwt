Remove serialization on response data in `BaseJSONWebTokenAPIView` because it 
breaks custom response payload handlers which add extra data to the response 
payload. This change aligns this fork more closely with the original and makes 
it easier to use this fork as a drop-in replacement for the original. Also 
change the ReponsePayload from a `namedtuple` to a dictionary because 
`namedtuple` is not JSON serializable
