* Support multiple algorithms and keys

  Existing code made key rollovers or algorithm changes hard and
  basically required a breaking change: Once any of `JWT_ALGORITHM`,
  `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, or `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY`/`JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` were
  changed, existing tokens were rendered invalid.

  We now support `JWT_ALGORITHM`, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, and
  `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` optionally being a list, where all members are
  accepted as valid.

  When `JWT_SECRET_KEY` is a list, the first member is used for
  signing and all others are accepted for verification.

* Support multiple keys with key ids

  We also support identifing keys by key id (`kid` header): When a JWT
  carries a key id, we can identify immediately if it is known and
  only need to make at most one verification attempt.

  To configure keys with ids, `JWT_SECRET_KEY`, `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and
  `JWT_PUBLIC_KEY` can now also be a dict in the form

  ```
  { "kid1": key1, "kid2": key2, ... }
  ```

  When a JWT does not carry a key id (`kid` header), the default is to
  fall back to trying all keys if keys are named (defined as a dict).
  Setting `JWT_INSIST_ON_KID: True` avoids this fallback and requires
  any JWT to be validated to carry a key id _if_ key IDs are used

  *NOTE: For python < 3.7, use a `collections.OrderedDict` object
  instead of a dict*

* Require cryptographic dependencies of PyJWT

  We changed the PyJWT requirement to include support for RSA by
  default. This was done to improve the user experience, but will lead
  to cryptography support be installed where not already present.
